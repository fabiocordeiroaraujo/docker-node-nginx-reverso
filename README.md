# Nginx + Node.js + MySQL Challenge

This project is a challenge that utilizes Nginx as a reverse proxy for a Node.js application, which in turn connects to a MySQL database and performs name registration and reading operations.

## Setup

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine before proceeding.

1. Clone the repository

   Clone this repository to your local environment:
